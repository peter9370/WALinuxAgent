Package: clamav
Description-md5: fb7be82d5591a0f3facf827f0a60c5d6
Description-en: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and
    obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
  - built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft
    Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.
 .
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

 NX is a software suite which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 nxagent is a nested Xserver providing NX transport of X sessions. The
 application is based on the well known Xnest "nested" server. nxagent,
 like Xnest, is an X server for its own clients, and at the same time, an
 X client for a system's local X server.
 .
 The main scope of nxagent is to eliminate X round-trips or transform
 them into asynchronous replies. nxagent works together with nxproxy.
 nxproxy itself does not make any effort to minimize round-trips
 by itself, this is demanded of nxagent.
 .
 Being an X server, nxagent is able to resolve all the property/atoms related
 requests locally, ensuring that the most common source of round-trips are
 nearly reduced to zero.
